## Loss function
1. Adversarial Loss\

2. Cycle Consistency Loss\
![Overview](https://github.com/Sooram/CycleGAN-tensorflow/blob/master/imgs/cycle-consistency-loss.PNG)\
"adversarial losses alone cannot guarantee that the learned function can map an individual input xi to a desired output yi. To further reduce the space of possible mapping functions, we argue that the learned mapping functions should be cycle-consistent
 for each image x from domain X, the image translation cycle should be able to bring x back to the original image, i.e., x → G(x) → F(G(x)) ≈ x."\

## Network architecture
Pretty complicated and a lot of restrictions. I haven't implemented PatchGAN for the discriminator.
1. Generator\
![Overview](https://github.com/Sooram/CycleGAN-tensorflow/blob/master/imgs/generator.PNG)\
"This network contains two stride-2 convolutions, several residual blocks [18], and two fractionally strided convolutions with stride 1 2 . We use 6 blocks for 128 × 128 images and 9 blocks for 256 × 256 and higher resolution training images. Similar to Johnson et al. [23], we use instance normalization [53]."

2. Discriminator\
![Overview](https://github.com/Sooram/CycleGAN-tensorflow/blob/master/imgs/discriminator.PNG)\
"For the discriminator networks we use 70 × 70 PatchGANs [22, 30, 29], which aim to classify whether 70 × 70 overlapping image patches are real or fake."

3. Training details
- use a least-square loss instead of the negative log likelihood objective for equation 1
- image pool size: 50 (update discriminators using 50 previously generated images to reduce model oscillation)
- λ = 10 in Equation 3
- optimizaer: Adam solver
- batch size: 1
- learning rate: 0.0002 for the first 100 epochs and linearly decay the rate to zero over the next 100 epochs

## Results
![Overview](https://github.com/Sooram/CycleGAN-tensorflow/blob/master/results.PNG)\
Tested with the test set after 91 epochs of training. It hasn't been trained completely(the paper suggests 200 epochs for training), so the result images are cracked(though I'm not sure if the images can be improved with more epochs of training or not).
